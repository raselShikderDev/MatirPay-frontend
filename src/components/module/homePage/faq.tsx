      question: "Who can use MatirWallet?",
      answer:
        "MatirWallet is built for two types of users: general Users and registered Agents. Users can send and receive money, while Agents help Users withdraw (cash out) or deposit (cash in) money into their wallet.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-2",
      question: "How can I send money using MatirWallet?",
      answer:
        "If you're a User, you can send money to any other MatirWallet User instantly through the app. Agents cannot send or receive money — they only facilitate cash-in and cash-out.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "How do I withdraw (cash out) money from MatirWallet?",
      answer:
        "To withdraw money, a User must visit a registered MatirWallet Agent. The Agent will process the cash-out request, and the User will receive the equivalent cash in hand.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "Can I add money to my MatirWallet account myself?",
      answer:
        "No. Users cannot directly add money. Only registered Agents can perform cash-in operations to top up a User’s wallet. Visit a nearby Agent to deposit funds into your account.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-5",
      question: "What can Agents do in MatirWallet?",
      answer:
        "Agents can perform two key tasks: (1) Cash In — deposit money into a User’s wallet, and (2) Cash Out — process a User’s withdrawal. Agents cannot send or receive money between users or other agents.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-6",
      question: "Is there a fee for cash in or cash out?",
      answer:
        "There may be a small service charge for cash-out transactions, set by MatirWallet or the Agent. Cash-in is usually free, but this can depend on the Agent's policy. All fees are shown before confirming the transaction.",
    },
    {
      id: "faq-7",
      question: "How do I become a MatirWallet Agent?",
      answer:
        "To register as an Agent, you must apply through the MatirWallet website or contact our support team. Agents must meet certain requirements and go through a verification process.",
